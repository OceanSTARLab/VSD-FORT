#  VSD-FORT: Estimating Channels With Hundreds of Sub-Paths for MU-MIMO Uplink: A Structured High-Rank Tensor Approach

This is authors' official PyTorch implementation for paper:"**Estimating Channels With Hundreds of Sub-Paths for MU-MIMO Uplink: A Structured High-Rank Tensor Approach**"[[IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10663962)].


## Key Idea
This letter introduces a structured high-rank tensor approach for estimating sub-6G uplink channels in multiuser multiple-input and multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems.
