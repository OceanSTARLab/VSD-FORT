This is authors' official implementation for the paper:"**Estimating Channels With Hundreds of Sub-Paths for MU-MIMO Uplink: A Structured High-Rank Tensor Approach**"[[IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10663962)], published in IEEE Signal Processing Letters.


## Key Idea
This letter introduces a structured high-rank tensor approach for estimating sub-6G uplink channels in multiuser multiple-input and multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems.

## Requirements:
The project is primarily developed in **MATLAB** and uses the packages `tensor_toolbox-master` and `tensorlab_2016-03-28`, both of which are self-contained.

## Instructions:
Run the `main.m` file to demonstrate the synthetic demo.
